# Advent of code but for SCH QPA

### Features
- Google and Github signin
- List programming problems with an HTTP based solutions API
- Team & Individual leaderboards

### Running this on your own
- See the docker compose, it should give you a rough idea how you could run this

### Problem support
- You have to add your own support for your own custom problems, see the examples in the repo (You can either write rust code and hook it up to the api project directly or create a separate API and use the ApiBasedProblemSupport connector)
