Camel case is when stuff is written like this: ```camelCase```, where new words begin on a capital letter instead of a space.

Your objective is to tell how many actual words are in a camel cased string.

Example input:
```
{
    "word": "helloWorld"
}
```

Example output:
```
{
    "word_count": 2
}
```

There is one sample input for this problem with the index of `0` and it containts the input above.

#### Constraints
Words are not going to be longer then 1000 characters.

Happy beta testing.
